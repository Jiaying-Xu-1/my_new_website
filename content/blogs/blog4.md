**My dance, my hobby, my love, and my redemption**

**1.** 

Chinese Classical Dance has been my passion since I was six years old. I love using my body to express my emotions. Tones, drums, spins, and jumps make me happy. Coming from a remote small town to Peking University, a top Chinese university located in an international metropolis, I felt lonely at first. During that time, I was confused, flustered, and unable to balance my studies and social life. Being away from home, all the pressure overwhelmed me.

Whenever I felt down, I went to a small dancing room on the third floor of the Student Center, played music on my phone, and immersed myself in spinning and jumping. At the beginning, I was not flexible enough to perform certain moves. But I never gave up. Through repetition, determination, and patience, I was able to make progress towards perfecting my craft as a dancer bit by bit. This hard work and gradual improvement helped me find my inner peace and rebuild my self-confidence.

I gradually became optimistic and cheerful, and my heart grew stronger than before. I met many friends who share my passion for dancing. Together, we joined the Peking University National Standard Dance Team. When dancing with my team members, I had a sense that we were working together to create beauty in our lives. Also, I participated in the 9th National Capital University Dance Competition on behalf of Peking University. With nearly 700 students in the competition, I won fourth place in the Tango Dance category. I found the rhythm of life again. And during my sophomore and junior years, I refocused and earned the all-school academic honors.

In order to help out other students who, like myself, were entering the campus with anxiety and confusion, I decided to create a short film with a classmate who studied media. It is a film starring me as a deaf girl whose unswerving passion for dancing triumphs over her physical disability; through sweat and tears, she finally becomes recognized by the world. I hope that my short film inspires all girls who battle insecurities and shield themselves from the world that is indeed a messy place, allowing them to find inspiration in their lives.

What is the purpose of life? One quote posits that it is the “Pursuing to find the core of life”. I have not found this core, yet. But I do think I have an answer to this question. It is that it does not matter how far one goes; it matters that one keeps moving. This is how I live my truth in this sometimes inhospitable world.
