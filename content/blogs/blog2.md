# My Journey

**Last year I went to Russia and spent a fabulous time by Lake Baikal.**

**I followed in the footsteps of poet Kenton M. Stewart and his poem: _Lake Baikal_.**

# Lake Baikal
### Kenton M. Stewart

I tried to get a sense of the wonder of Baikal,  
but its majesty was just too great for words to fit it all.  
I thought about its beauty and its volume besting all.  
It’s hard to know just where to start when thinking of Baikal.  

For over 20 million years unique forms have evolved.  
The lake’s a bank of DNA with secrets not yet solved.  
The bio-diversity, of forms both large and small,  
shows that “survival of the fittest” is the case in Lake Baikal.  

So let’s hear it for the inverts, fish, and even for the seal,  
and all those plants and species where endemic forms are real.  
For Baikal is not a treasure for the locals there to hide,  
or even for one country using it to gain some pride.  

But the lake is a treasure for the whole world to preserve,  
yet if it’s not protected… then it’s one we don’t deserve.  
Economic exploitation, a boon and yet a curse,  
will take a toll on Baikal…not for better, just for worse.  

So how can we preserve Baikal and show we really care?  
That’s a question that will haunt you… once you have been there.  
Seasons come and seasons go in ancient Lake Baikal.  
I’m in wonder of that treasure. I’m in love with Lake Baikal.
